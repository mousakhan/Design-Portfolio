## ViiMe

ViiMe was a project created by my best friend. The idea was that venue owners could provide unique deals to people if they come in groups. The project required creating a web application for venue owners and a mobile application for patrons. 

### Mobile

#### Background
The mobile application was the method for patrons to easily redeem deals at specific venues. They would need to search through venues, find a deal they like, and then be able to redeem it. It was to be available on both iOS & Android. 

#### User Requirements



### Web

#### Background

#### User Requirements
The user requirements were created by interviewing venue owners on what they would want from the application.
