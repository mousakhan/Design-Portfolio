# ViiMe

ViiMe was a project created by my best friend and one of his friends. The idea was that venue owners could provide unique deals to people if they come in groups. The project required creating a web application for venue owners and a mobile application for patrons. 

There were certain requirements laid out from the founders, and they were as follows:

1. The mobile application must be available on both iOS and Android
2. The mobile application and web application must be made within three months for launch
3. ...

## Mobile

### Background
The mobile application was the method for patrons to easily redeem deals at specific venues. They would need to search through venues, find a deal they like, and then be able to redeem it. 

When the user first opens the application, they will land on the Login page. They must enter a username and password to login. If they do not have an account, they can click a 'Not a member? Sign up now!' button. If they forgot their password, they can click the 'Forgot Password?' button.

After they login, they will head to the groups page. To redeem deals, users must form groups by inviting their friends. If there are any active groups to redeem deals, this is where they will appear. The reason for having groups is that we can track who has redeemed what deal, and this information can be conveyed to venue owners. They can redeem any deals or invite friends to deals on this page. When they want to redeem, a pop-up appears where a code must be entered. Employees at venues know this code, and would enter it in for the deal to be redeemed.

From this page, there are 3 places to go: the profile page, friends list page, or to browsing venues.

The profile page is where users can update their personal information. Another feature the founders wanted was 'vRewards'. 
There were rewards sent directly from venue owners to users to thank them for their loyalty.

The friends list page lists all friends, and there is a button to add a friend. When adding a friend, they will type in the username of their friend and all possible matches will show up in their search.

Finally, they can browse venues. On this page, all venues with deals are listed. They can search through the venues and when they click on one, they will see venue information and deals. If they click on a deal, they will see the possible things they can redeem depending on how big their group is. On the top right, there is a button to invite friends to their group.

To summarize, the current application flow is shown below.

The next step will be to improve the interface through this course. We will start afresh with user requirements.

####  User Requirements

With the application published, feedback was collected from users. Furthermore, I asked 3 friends with no prior knowledge of the application some questions. I wanted to see how they would navigate the application and where some chokepoints for users might be, along with their general impressions of the application.

The tasks that I asked were:

1. Please redeem a deal (the deal to redeem was given)
2. What are your overall impressions of the application?
3. What would you improve?

To summarize findings, here are the key points:

- Users really did not understand the concept of having to create a group, invite your friends (which means adding friends to your friends list), and then redeeming.
-  There were some layout concerns, especially with the venue information page and deals page.
- They liked the idea of the application
